This Supervised ML project predicts the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.
It is a simple linear linear regression task which involves just 2 variables.

I have used python language for this project.

The libraries used are :

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
Dataset available here : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv

The Linear Regression model predicts the precentage of a student if he/she studies for specified hours.
